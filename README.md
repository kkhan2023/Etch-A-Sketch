# Etch-A-Sketch

Project 3: Etch-A-Sketch with UI

Objective: Create Etch-A-Sketch game using primarily CSS & JavaScript. Starting off with a 16x16 grid and allow user input to change size of grid from values 1-100.

Learning outcome:

- Created function with loop to generate divs into container via JS
- Used mouseover event listener to make grids change colour on mouse hovering.
- Used button click event listener to generate a user prompt so a value can be entered to change the grid size.

Additional outcomes:

- Added UI completely through JavaScript and CSS
- Additionally, implemented a progressive darkening effect where each interaction darkens the square by 10%. The goal was to achieve a fully black (or completely colored) square in only ten interactions.
- Added feature to randomize the squaresâ€™ RGB values with each interaction.
